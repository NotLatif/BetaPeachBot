5. create a New Application, change settings as you pleas
6. go to `Bot` on the left and click `Add Bot`
7. click `Reset token` and copy it (WARNING: the token grants access to your bot, do not share your token)
8. paste your token without quotes in the `.env` file replacing `SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN`
9. on the Developer portal, enable everything under `Privileged gateway intents`
10. click on `OAuth2` -> `Url generator`
