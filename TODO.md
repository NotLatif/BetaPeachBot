âœ… When user suggests a song restart with the new song

âœ… Test suggestion function entirely

âœ… Test culoplaylists with multiple tracks

âœ… Test /play and /add_song to see if they support url1, url2 and playlists with multiple urls

âœ… Support for youtu.be URLs

âœ… **[FEATURE]** Specify queue position when using pnext

âœ… **[FEATURE]** /add {track} {position}
position can be START, END, number

âœ… **[WEIRD]** using /play two times uses the same queue variable what???

âœ… **[BUG]** Try `/play randomsite.com`, bot does not disconnect from vc after detecting error

âœ… **[BUG]** Culobot EMBED sometimes hangs for some reason (pausing solves it??? wtf) (it still stops updating) maybe the process dies at some point idk (test with callback???? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THETHIE RHAEIRJHOI) solved :)

âœ… **[FIX]** modules should be enabled by default and not the other way around.

âœ… **[FIX]** MUSIC REPORT SYSTEM

âœ… **[TODO]** musicbot slash commands

âœ… **[TODO]** Rewrite musicPlayer.py


# Culobot features
ðŸŸ¥ willdo in the next version
option to save playlist name internally when using a playlist link

ðŸŸ¥ not doing this as this feature is useless for now
Bot does not know when the player finished playing, possible solution:
    Leverage the EmbedHandler coroutine (when it returns the player is usually done)
