# Culobot bugs

âœ… prevent users that are not in the audiochat to use embed buttons for musicbot

âœ… restart: ripete la traccia

âœ… bug where thumbnails are abot the previous song / embed is frozen / other bug related to the queue embed
    how to reproduce:
    - use a playlist with enough tracks
    - join a vc and use the /play command to start the playlist
    - move in another channel and move the bot using the discord "move to channel"
    - the bot should stil be working but now the embed is frozen
    - try to restart the queue using the !queue command [maybe you need to let the bot start a new track before idk]
    - The bug should appear
    - The embed message will only update if you interact with it (for example skipping)

âœ… Aggiungere una canzone alla volta fa cose strane allo shuffle (seems to have been fixed by accident)
