# Culobot bugs

âœ… prevent users that are not in the audiochat to use embed buttons for musicbot

âœ… restart: ripete la traccia

âœ… bug where thumbnails are abot the previous song / embed is frozen / other bug related to the queue embed
    how to reproduce:
    - use a playlist with enough tracks
    - join a vc and use the /play command to start the playlist
    - move in another channel and move the bot using the discord "move to channel"
    - the bot should stil be working but now the embed is frozen
    - try to restart the queue using the !queue command [maybe you need to let the bot start a new track before idk]
    - The bug should appear
    - The embed message will only update if you interact with it (for example skipping)

ðŸŸ¦ there are too many files in the main folder, reorganize?

ðŸŸ¦ inform user when bot can't find song (404 in musicPlayer.py)

ðŸŸ¦ fix suggest command

ðŸŸ¦ graphical bug while skipping with 1 song loop

ðŸŸ¦ Aggiungere una canzone alla volta fa cose strane allo shuffle

ðŸŸ¦ Raramente puÃ² capitare che queue e canzoni in riproduzione si desincronizzano???? (Bug copia.txt)

ðŸŸ¦ Check what happens when keys are not in the .env file

ðŸŸ¥ reorganize musicPlayer.MessageHandler.getEmbed()

# Code things

ðŸŸ¥ Make settings a local variable under MyBot class
